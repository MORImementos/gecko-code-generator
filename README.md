Basic gecko code generator for Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. Able to convert bytes/halfwords/words/floats into appropriate gecko codes. Can likely be used for other games as well. Missing several QoL features but the basics are there, including a clipboard copy and an export as txt option.
